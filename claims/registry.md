## CLM-0001 — evidence-aware inventory resolution

Hypothesis: for fixed inventory artifacts and policy, the resolver selects the
lawful pure realization exactly when accepted evidence covers every required
obligation, rejects the standing broken realization with structured reasons,
and executes the selected realization with the reference trace.

Expected observation: the demo selects `realization.inventory.pure`, reports
passing `example_test` evidence bound to exact identities, rejects
`realization.inventory.broken`, and ends with the declared events and state.

Counterexample: missing or stale evidence still permits selection; the broken
realization passes; two eligible candidates are silently ordered; or the
proof-only policy accepts test evidence.

Evaluation method: deterministic conformance fixtures, identity mutation tests,
policy counter-tests, CLI snapshot assertions, and independent adversarial
review.

Success threshold: every design-spec acceptance condition passes on the
committed artifact in the pinned Nix environment.

Consequence if falsified: do not accept or publish the tracer claim; revise the
identity, oracle, or policy boundary named by the failing counterexample.

Observed result (2026-07-29): the pure realization passed 9/9 finite cases and
the standing broken realization passed 7/9. Development policy selected only
the pure realization; proof-only policy rejected both. This is `example_test`
evidence under visible Python-adapter, integer-arithmetic, and fixture-coverage
assumptions. It does not establish universal correctness.

Invalidation: any change to the theory, realization, recipe, adapter, or runner
requires the command and exact-binding drift test to pass again. Policy changes
change eligibility, not the historical test result.
